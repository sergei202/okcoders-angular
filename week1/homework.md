# Week 1 Homework

## Part 1 - Setup
- Create a new Angular application
- Add `FormsModule` (so we can use `ngModel`) to `app.module.ts`
- Clear out the default/demo HTML in `AppComponent`


## Part 2 - About Me
Create a new component called `AboutMe` and get it to show up (adding it to `AppComponent`).

This component will ask 3 things from you: your name, your age, and your favorite activity.

It will then display that information: "My name is [name], I am [age] years old, and I love [activity]."

## Part 3 - Calculator
This will be a twist on the simple calculator we did in class: This calculator will use a select box to specify the operation (`+`,`-`,`/`,`*`).

Create a `Calculator` component with:
- Two inputs, `num1` and `num2`
- A select box with 4 options: `+`,`-`,`/`,`*`
- A `=` button
- A place (a `div`) to display the answer
