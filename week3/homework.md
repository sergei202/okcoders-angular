# Week 3 Homework

This week's homework will also be your final project that we'll add on to and wrap up in class, so please complete it!

We'll also publish it to Heroku host it live for the world to see!

We're going to create a blog website with dynamic articles.  The site will be a SPA with 3 main pages:
- Home
- About
- Articles

Home and About will just be static pages without dynamic content.  Articles will show a list of articles (`ArticleList`) and will allow you to click one to see the full article (`ArticleDetail`).

## Part 1 - Setup and Framework

- Create a new Angular application with routing
- Add bootstrap
- Create your components:
	- `Nav`
	- `Home`
	- `About`
	- `ArticleList`
	- `ArticleDetail`

So far in the course we haven't taken time to slow down and make things look _nice_.
Take some time to make this your own site.  Add text, colors, and images to Home and About.

By the end of this, you should have a SPA blog site with a Home, About, and Articles section.
You should have some type of menu/navigation on the side or top of your blog. Home and About will have static content and Articles (`ArticleList`) will be empty.

## Part 2 - Articles
